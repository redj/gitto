#
# Explaination
#
# GittoOnSave will look for every Gitto repository potentially tracking
# the file that's just been saved. Those are all the Gitto repositories
# in parent directories of the file that's been saved.
#
# For each Gitto repository it finds, GittoOnSave will call _gitto_ with
# the _flash_ command in that repository's directory.
#
# Please see Gitto documentation for the details on the _flash_ command.
#

# Change Log
# (Time stamps are given in GMT-5.)
#
# 2012.12.03 20.58  -  Final Version
#                      This program should be considered complete and mature.
#                      I don't expect the source code will change at all in the future.
#                      The documentation part might see some changes.

#
# Notes on Operation
#
# Gitto and it's dependencies (Git) must be installed of course.
# Make sure the gitto program is in your system path.
